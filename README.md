# DSA Practice Group

Welcome to our **DSA Practice Group**! We are a group of individuals dedicated to improving our Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) skills by taking turns interviewing each other. After each practice session, everyone is encouraged to push their solutions to this repository.

## How We Practice

1. **Interviews**: Each session, one member acts as the interviewer while the rest take on the role of interviewees. The interviewer selects problems that focus on different DSA topics.
   
2. **Problem-Solving**: All interviewees attempt to solve the given problems within a set time(usually 40 mins). This process helps simulate real interview conditions.
   
3. **Discussion**: After the time is up, we discuss each approach, analyze the solutions, and provide constructive feedback.

4. **Solution Submission**: At the end of each session, everyone is required to submit their solutions to this repository. Solutions should be well-documented and follow the repository's coding guidelines.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

- Each **date** has its own folder named `dd-mm-yyyy`.
- You have to push your code under the folder created above. 
- Make sure your code file has Problem statement defined in the comment at the top of the file along with examples.
